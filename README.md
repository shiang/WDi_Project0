## NOT a typical Tic Tac Toe Game

This is the result of a week of hard work, plus poor time management and planning.
You can play this Tic Tac Toe game with your friend, and yes, only your friend.

I was too obsessed to get the computer player part of the code working but failed miserably at the end, and didn't have enough time prettying this thing up!

You can however same the game state and restore the previously state or reset it.

### Imaginary Roadmap

Better late than never, below are the imaginary future plans for this game:

- [ ] Get the computer player code WORKING!!
- [ ] Maybe more CSS styling and some animation
- [ ] Display a more modern looking pop-up message
- [ ] Allow players to change their markers (data structure is ready)
- [ ] Get the score display (data structure is ready)
- [ ] Display who's currently playing
- [ ] Replace localStorage with Firebase!!
- [ ] Cloud messaging (why not if with Firebase working)
